# FileCompression


Design: The design I originally started doing, was making different classes for each potential command line call. I had unintentionally misheard the client and thought he wanted that. Thus I had to redo half the project and combine all of my Deschub functions. Like I said I had originally had created them in each of their own classes. This led to a fairly easy to read SchubsH and SchubsL classes. I simply treat all of the text files that are going to be compressed as string arrays and simply use that string array to hold the paths of each file and pass that string array through a loop that then compresses each file. I believe I did almost the exact same style for the LZW algorithm as well. I feel like should be ways to definitely shorten the Huffman algorithm. Possibly not care so much about the trie, but I understand that reading the trie can be fairly quick but personally I have to read so that seems like a lose lose situation for me.

Testing & Instructions: You are going to start off with an mvn test. This will proceed to test all of the test I have written. This will cause many new files to be written. Before you do anything else be sure to go into the Compressed folder and delete the files unless you don’t mind writing over them. Then you may proceed to call ShubsL src/resources/*txt. This will use the LZW algorithm to compress these text files. Then to check your work you may then proceed to Deschubs src/compressed/*.ll. This will expand all of the .ll files in the compressed folder and expand them inside the decompressed folder. Then you may run SchubsH src/resources/*.txt and you will see all of the .hh compressed files inside of the compressed folder. Again you may want to check and see if you have the correct compressed files so you may expand them by calling Deschubs src/compression/*.hh. This will expand all of the .hh files and send them over to the Decompressed folder. When mvn test first ones it Tars the files and Untars them. Creating the Unarchived file that holds all of the Unarchived and expanded versions of the compressed files that were tarred. I have somehow integrated Tarring and Untarring to work simultaneously if you were to call SchubsArc archive.zh. I am unsure how I have managed to do this but it works. Sometimes when running command line instructions things can get a bit tricky, for instance you might try and run a Deschub on compressed files that aren’t their. Thus you need to be sure to check what you clean up and what you have not created yet. I suggest
For what the actaul command “mvn test”. I wrote tests for each class that we are using for the CLI. For example, I wrote a test file and some functions for each of the SchubsL, SchubsH, Deschubs, and SchubsArc. In these tests I tried my best to simulate what a command line argument would be and thus when I passed the tests I knew that my classes were sufficient. Thus when you start with mvn test, it goes through every test I wrote that is checking each of the classes.
